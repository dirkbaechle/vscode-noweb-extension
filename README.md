# Noweb Extension for Visual Studio Code

This is an extension for Visual Studio Code, supporting [Literate Programming](http://www.literateprogramming.com) using
the [Noweb](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/) tool written by Norman Ramsey.

Its main goal is to provide a somewhat decent syntax highlighting for Noweb files.

*Note: This is a work in progress and has been tested with Noweb versions 2.x only.*

## Features

- Basic syntax highlighting.

## Known Issues

Noweb common file extensions, `.nw` and `.noweb`, may conflict with other tools.
